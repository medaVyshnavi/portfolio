### Project purpose and goal

One of my goals in becoming a front-end developer is to build at least one game.

### Web stack and explanation

<!-- - React
- Styled Components
- Recoil
- React Beautiful DnD -->

The only reason I took up this project was to try everything that I have learned in React like passing props between components.
React has always been my go-to framework for building web apps.

### Problem and thought process

I had to jot down the problem into multiple steps leading me to learn Fisher–Yates shuffle Algorithm that works in O(n) time complexity.

### Useful resources
