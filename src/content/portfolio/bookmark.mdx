### Project purpose and goal

The purpose of this project is to revise how to use Fetch API to get data and display data to the user.

### Lesson learned

Although this is a rather simple project, I still learned a thing or two from it. Aside from learning how to use Fetch API, I also learned how to use the `setInterval()` function to generate random advice within a specific amount of time. Other than that, I learned how to use the `box-shadow` property to create a shadow effect on the button with this code `box-shadow: 0 0 40px -5px var(--neon-green);`

### Future improvements

The Advice Slip API does provide some other options to fetch data in different ways. I would like to add search functionality to the app or let the user looks through the advice by the id in ascending order.

### Useful resourcesd

- [MDN Fetch API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - This helped me relearn the syntax for using `Fetch API`.
- [MDN box-shadow documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - I always forget what does each value represent in the `box-shadow` property.
- [Center a `position: absolute` element](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8508275/how-to-center-a-position-absolute-element) - This helped me in centering the randomize button at the center.
