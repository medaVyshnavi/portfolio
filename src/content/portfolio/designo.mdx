### Project purpose and goal

The main purpose of this project is to take advantages of the capabilities of Next.js and have a functional web site up and running quickly. Secondly, I want to become familiar with the framework itself and its convenient features.

### Web stack and explanation

<!-- - Next
- TailwindCSS
- API
- SWR -->

I loved using Next.js because it makes building apps a smoother experience for developers.The file-system based router built into Next.js allows me to create static and dynamic pages easily. Each technology in the stack has one thing in common, which is that they all have well-written documentations.

### Problem and thought process

Although this is not a particularly big project, I still think it is a good practice to have an organized project structure as well as reusable components that could be used in multiple places.

### Lesson learned

I could not count how many lessons that I have learned from building this application. However, the most important thing I became clear was usage of after and before css property
And being able to use 3rd party libraries like leaflet JS
