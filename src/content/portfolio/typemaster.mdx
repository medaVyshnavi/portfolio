### Problem and thought process

At first, I was planning to build the layout with only CSS Grid as suggested in the challenge details. But I only used that for the last section with the four logos.

I was also struggling with `overflow:hidden` that didn't work, I still am, that's why I styled the first keyboard image a bit differently.

There is one picture with an orange overlay I didn't get it to work like the original design. I wanted to give up trying after a few times, because `opacity` didn't work out as the effect I want, and setting the `background-color`'s alpha channel didn't work as well. Later, I decided to take a look at the code snippet section we have in Figma. I saw a `mix-blend-mode` property was used and I tried that out and I think the color looks much prettier with this property.

About the responsiveness of this challenge, I believe there must be a better way of doing it, my way is more of a brute-force style. I used absolute positioning for the images and set different breakpoints to have different sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Why does position absolute make page to overflow?](https://newbedev.com/why-does-position-absolute-make-page-to-overflow) - This helped me for understanding why overflow does not work as we expected.
- [When importing a file with @use then: Error Undefined Mixin](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66365150/when-importing-a-file-with-use-then-error-undefined-mixin) - This is the exact question that I asked on Google as I received the same error message when I couldn't get to use the mixins that I have defined in `_mixins.scss`. Therefore, I have to import like so: `@use 'mixins as *`.
